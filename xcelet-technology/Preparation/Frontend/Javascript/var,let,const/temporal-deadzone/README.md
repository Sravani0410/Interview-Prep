The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a behavior in JavaScript that applies to variables declared with let and const. It refers to the period between the start of a block (such as a function or a loop) and the point at which the variable is declared and initialized. During this period, the variable cannot be accessed, and any attempt to do so will result in a ReferenceError.
