## useRef and ForwardRef:

useRef: It allows you to access a particular HTML element there are lot of people who do give an ID to an element and then use get element by ID users appear the javascript element.which is wrong way to do it . so React provided the useRef hook so you provide a reference to a particular element and we can access it using the reference
