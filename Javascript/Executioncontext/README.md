D (Definition):
An execution context refers to the environment in which a piece of code is executed. It includes information such as variables, scope, and this keyword binding.

U (Use case scenarios):
Understanding execution context is crucial for developers, especially when dealing with scope and variable hoisting. For example, in JavaScript, knowing the execution context helps in understanding how functions are invoked and how variables are accessed within different scopes.

B (Benefits):
By understanding execution context, developers can debug their code more effectively, predict variable scope, and avoid unexpected behavior. It also facilitates better comprehension of how code interacts with the runtime environment.
