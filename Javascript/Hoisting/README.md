D (Definition):
Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, regardless of where they are declared within the scope.

U (Use case scenarios):
Understanding hoisting helps developers predict the behavior of their code. For instance, in JavaScript, variables can be used before they are declared due to hoisting. Knowing this behavior prevents errors and aids in writing cleaner code.

B (Benefits):
Hoisting allows for more flexible coding styles and can prevent certain types of errors. It simplifies the mental model of how JavaScript code executes by ensuring that all declarations are processed before any code is executed.
