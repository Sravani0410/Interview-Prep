D (Definition):

Pure Function: A pure function is a function that always produces the same output for the same input and has no side effects. In other words, it depends only on its input parameters to produce a result and does not modify state or interact with external systems. Pure functions are deterministic and idempotent.
U (Use case scenarios):

Pure functions are commonly used in functional programming paradigms to write code that is easier to reason about, test, and maintain.
They are particularly useful in scenarios where predictability, immutability, and referential transparency are important, such as in data transformation, filtering, and mapping operations.
B (Benefits):

Pure functions promote code purity and reduce complexity by minimizing dependencies, side effects, and mutable state. They improve code reliability and predictability by eliminating hidden interactions and implicit dependencies.
They facilitate code optimization, parallelization, and caching, as pure functions can be safely memoized and executed in parallel without interfering with each other.
