Let's explain event bubbling and capturing using the DUBX format:

D (Definition):

Event Bubbling: Event bubbling is a mechanism in the DOM (Document Object Model) where an event triggered on a nested element is propagated up through its ancestors in the DOM hierarchy. This means that the event handler attached to the innermost element is invoked first, followed by its parent elements up to the root element.
Event Capturing: Event capturing is the reverse of event bubbling. It's a mechanism where an event triggered on a parent element is captured first at the root of the DOM hierarchy and then propagated down through its descendants until it reaches the target element.
U (Use case scenarios):

Event Bubbling: Event bubbling is useful when you want to handle an event at multiple levels of the DOM hierarchy. It allows you to attach a single event handler to a parent element and have it handle events triggered by its descendant elements.
Event Capturing: Event capturing is less commonly used than event bubbling but can be useful in certain scenarios where you want to intercept an event before it reaches its target element. It enables you to handle events at the early stages of propagation.
B (Benefits):

Event Bubbling: Event bubbling promotes code reusability and simplifies event handling by allowing you to attach event handlers at higher levels of the DOM hierarchy, reducing the need for attaching handlers to individual elements.
Event Capturing: Event capturing provides more control over event propagation and allows you to intercept events at earlier stages, potentially optimizing event handling and improving performance in complex DOM structures.

In this example:

Clicking on the "Click me!" text triggers a click event that propagates up through the DOM hierarchy.
With event bubbling, the innermost element's event handler is invoked first, followed by its parent elements up to the root element.
With event capturing, the outermost element's event handler is invoked first, followed by its child elements down to the target element.
