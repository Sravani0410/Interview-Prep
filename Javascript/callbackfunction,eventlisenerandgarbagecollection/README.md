D (Definition):

Callback Function: A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked inside the outer function. Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous programming to handle responses from asynchronous operations or to execute code after a certain task completes.
Event Listener: An event listener is a function that listens for a specific event to occur and executes a callback function in response to that event. Event listeners are commonly used in web development to handle user interactions such as clicks, keypresses, and form submissions.
Garbage Collection: Garbage collection is the automatic process by which a programming language's runtime system frees memory that is no longer in use or needed by the program. In JavaScript, the garbage collector periodically scans for unreferenced objects and deallocates their memory to prevent memory leaks and optimize memory usage.
U (Use case scenarios):

Callback Function: Callback functions are widely used in JavaScript for handling asynchronous tasks such as AJAX requests, timeouts, and event-driven programming. They allow developers to write non-blocking code and manage the flow of asynchronous operations.
Event Listener: Event listeners are essential for creating interactive web applications. They enable developers to respond to user interactions in real-time, updating the UI or triggering specific actions based on user input.
Garbage Collection: Garbage collection helps manage memory in JavaScript by automatically reclaiming memory allocated to objects that are no longer accessible. It prevents memory leaks and ensures efficient memory usage, especially in long-running applications or applications with complex object lifecycles.
B (Benefits):

Callback Function: Using callback functions enables developers to write asynchronous code that is easier to understand and maintain. They facilitate modular code design and promote reusability by allowing functions to be passed as arguments.
Event Listener: Event listeners enhance user experience by enabling dynamic and responsive interactions in web applications. They decouple event handling logic from the application's core functionality, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
Garbage Collection: Garbage collection automates memory management in JavaScript, reducing the risk of memory-related errors and improving overall application stability. It simplifies memory management for developers, allowing them to focus on writing application logic without worrying about memory allocation and deallocation.
