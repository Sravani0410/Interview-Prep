D (Definition):

Higher-Order Function: A higher-order function is a function that can take other functions as arguments and/or return functions as results. In other words, it either accepts functions as parameters, returns a function, or both.
Functional Programming: Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It emphasizes the use of pure functions, higher-order functions, and immutable data to create predictable and maintainable software.
U (Use case scenarios):

Higher-Order Function: Higher-order functions are used to abstract and generalize common patterns in code, enabling code reuse and modularity. They are often used for tasks such as filtering arrays, mapping values, reducing collections, and composing functions.
Functional Programming: Functional programming is beneficial when writing code that emphasizes clarity, predictability, and maintainability. It promotes the use of declarative programming, immutability, and higher-order functions to write concise and expressive code.
B (Benefits):

Higher-Order Function: Higher-order functions promote code reuse, modularity, and composability by enabling the encapsulation of common behaviors into reusable components. They facilitate the implementation of advanced programming patterns such as function composition, currying, and partial application.
Functional Programming: Functional programming encourages writing code that is easier to understand, test, and maintain. It reduces side effects and mutable state, leading to more predictable behavior and fewer bugs. Functional programming principles can also improve performance by enabling better optimization opportunities and parallelization.
