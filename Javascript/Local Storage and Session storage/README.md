D (Definition):

Local Storage: Local Storage is a web storage mechanism available in modern web browsers that allows web applications to store key-value pairs persistently on the client-side. The data stored in Local Storage remains intact even after the browser is closed and reopened, providing long-term storage capabilities.
Session Storage: Session Storage is another web storage mechanism similar to Local Storage but with a key difference. Session Storage allows web applications to store key-value pairs for the duration of a browser session. The data stored in Session Storage is cleared when the browser tab or window is closed.
U (Use case scenarios):

Local Storage: Local Storage is suitable for storing data that needs to be retained across browser sessions, such as user preferences, settings, or cached data.
Session Storage: Session Storage is useful for storing transient data that is only needed for the duration of a single browser session, such as temporary state, session-specific data, or navigation history.
B (Benefits):

Local Storage: Local Storage provides persistent storage capabilities, allowing web applications to store data indefinitely on the client-side without worrying about data loss between browser sessions. It's ideal for implementing features like user authentication, shopping carts, or offline capabilities.
Session Storage: Session Storage offers a lightweight storage solution for managing session-specific data without the overhead of long-term storage. It helps to maintain state and share data within a single browser session without affecting other sessions or persisting data beyond the session lifetime.
