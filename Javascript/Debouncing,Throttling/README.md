D (Definition):

Debouncing: Debouncing is a technique used to limit the rate at which a function is invoked, particularly in response to frequent events such as scrolling, resizing, or typing. It ensures that the function is only executed after a specified delay has elapsed since the last invocation of the function. This helps to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary executions of the function.
Throttling: Throttling is a technique used to limit the number of times a function can be invoked within a specified time interval. It ensures that the function is not invoked more than once during the interval, even if it is triggered multiple times. Throttling is useful for tasks such as handling mousemove or scroll events to prevent excessive resource consumption and improve user experience.
U (Use case scenarios):

Debouncing: Debouncing is commonly used in scenarios where rapid firing of events could lead to performance issues or undesired behavior, such as handling autocomplete suggestions or search inputs.
Throttling: Throttling is useful in scenarios where frequent triggering of events could overwhelm the system or lead to unnecessary processing, such as handling scrolling, resizing, or mousemove events in web applications.
B (Benefits):

Debouncing: Debouncing helps to optimize performance and improve user experience by reducing the frequency of function invocations, thereby preventing unnecessary processing and avoiding UI flickering or jittering caused by rapid updates.
Throttling: Throttling helps to prevent excessive resource consumption and improve the responsiveness of applications by limiting the rate at which functions are invoked, ensuring that they are executed at a controlled and manageable pace.
