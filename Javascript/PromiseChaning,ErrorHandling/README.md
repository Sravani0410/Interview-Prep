D (Definition):

Promise Chaining: Promise chaining is a technique used in asynchronous programming with promises to execute multiple asynchronous operations sequentially, one after the other. It involves attaching multiple .then() handlers to a promise, where each .then() handler returns a new promise, allowing for the chaining of asynchronous operations in a readable and organized manner.
Error Handling: Error handling in promises involves using the .catch() method to handle errors that occur during the execution of asynchronous operations. The .catch() method is typically appended to a chain of .then() handlers and is responsible for catching and handling any rejected promises or errors thrown within the promise chain.
U (Use case scenarios):

Promise Chaining: Promise chaining is useful when you need to perform multiple asynchronous operations sequentially, where the result of one operation depends on the result of the previous one. It helps in organizing and structuring asynchronous code, especially when dealing with complex workflows or dependency chains.
Error Handling: Error handling is essential for gracefully handling errors that may occur during asynchronous operations, such as network errors, server errors, or validation errors. Proper error handling ensures that the application remains robust and responsive even in the face of unexpected failures.
B (Benefits):

Promise Chaining: Promise chaining promotes code readability and maintainability by allowing developers to express complex asynchronous workflows in a sequential and organized manner. It eliminates the need for nested callback functions, making the code easier to understand and reason about.
Error Handling: Error handling with promises provides a consistent and centralized mechanism for managing errors across asynchronous operations. It allows developers to handle errors gracefully, log diagnostic information, and recover from failures without crashing the application.
