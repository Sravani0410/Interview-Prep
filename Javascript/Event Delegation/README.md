D (Definition):

Event Delegation: Event delegation is a programming technique in JavaScript where instead of attaching event handlers to individual elements, you attach a single event handler to a parent element. This parent element then listens for events that bubble up from its descendant elements. When an event occurs, the parent element's event handler is invoked, and you can determine which descendant element triggered the event using event delegation.
U (Use case scenarios):

Event Delegation is useful in scenarios where you have multiple elements that share the same type of event (e.g., click, change) and you want to handle them collectively. It's particularly handy when dealing with dynamically generated or frequently changing elements.
It's commonly used in lists, menus, or tables where individual items need to be interacted with but can change dynamically.
B (Benefits):

Event Delegation promotes code efficiency and simplicity by reducing the number of event handlers attached to individual elements. Instead, you have a single event handler attached to a parent element, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
It improves performance, especially in situations with a large number of elements, as there are fewer event handlers to manage and less memory overhead.

In this example:

We have a <ul> element with several <li> elements representing a list.
Instead of attaching click event handlers to each <li> element individually, we attach a single click event handler to the <ul> element.
When a click event occurs, the event bubbles up from the clicked <li> element to the <ul> element.
In the event handler, we check if the clicked element (event.target) has the class list-item, indicating that it's one of the list items. If so, we log the text content of the clicked item.
Event delegation allows us to handle click events on all list items with a single event handler, even for dynamically added or removed items. This improves code maintainability and performance.
