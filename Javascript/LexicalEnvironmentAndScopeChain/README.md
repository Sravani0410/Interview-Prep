D (Definition):
A lexical environment in JavaScript is a data structure that holds identifiers (variables and functions) and their corresponding values as well as a reference to the outer lexical environment. The scope chain refers to the hierarchy of lexical environments that determines the accessibility of identifiers within nested scopes.

U (Use case scenarios):
Understanding lexical environments and scope chains is essential for understanding variable scope resolution in JavaScript. Developers often encounter situations where they need to access variables from different scopes, and understanding how lexical environments and scope chains work helps them predict the behavior of their code.

B (Benefits):
By understanding lexical environments and scope chains, developers can write more maintainable and bug-free code. They can predict how variables will be resolved in different scopes, which leads to fewer unexpected errors and clearer code organization.
