D (Definition):

Currying: Currying is a functional programming technique that involves transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of nested unary functions (functions that take only one argument). Each function in the sequence takes one argument and returns a new function that expects the next argument until all arguments are provided, and the original function is invoked.
U (Use case scenarios):

Currying is useful in scenarios where you want to create specialized versions of a function with partial application of arguments.
It enables the creation of reusable function factories that generate new functions tailored to specific use cases or configurations.
B (Benefits):

Currying promotes code reuse and modularity by allowing functions to be composed and partially applied, making them more flexible and adaptable to different contexts.
It facilitates the creation of higher-order functions and function composition, enabling the construction of complex behavior from simpler building blocks.
