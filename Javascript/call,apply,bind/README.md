D (Definition):

call: The call method is a built-in function in JavaScript that allows you to invoke a function with a specified this context and arguments provided individually.
apply: The apply method is similar to call, but it accepts arguments as an array or an array-like object rather than individually.
bind: The bind method is used to create a new function with a specified this context, which cannot be changed later, and optionally pre-bound arguments.
U (Use case scenarios):

call: call is commonly used when you want to invoke a function with a specific this context and pass arguments individually.
apply: apply is useful when you want to invoke a function with a specific this context and pass arguments as an array or array-like object.
bind: bind is often used to create a new function with a fixed this context, which is particularly useful when you want to create a function with a specific this context to be invoked later.
B (Benefits):

call: Using call allows for dynamic context switching, enabling functions to be invoked with different this contexts as needed.
apply: apply is useful when dealing with functions that accept a variable number of arguments or when the arguments are already in an array-like format.
bind: bind creates a new function with a fixed this context, making it suitable for scenarios where you want to create a function with a specific this value that remains unchanged.
