Let's delve into promises using the DUBX format:

D (Definition):

Promise: A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It is a placeholder for a value that may become available in the future, either resolving with a value or rejecting with a reason. Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous code compared to traditional callback functions.
U (Use case scenarios):

Promises are commonly used when working with asynchronous operations such as fetching data from a server, reading files, or waiting for user input.
They are particularly useful for handling sequences of asynchronous tasks, chaining multiple operations together, and dealing with error handling in asynchronous code.
B (Benefits):

Promises simplify asynchronous programming by providing a standardized interface for working with asynchronous operations, making code easier to read, write, and maintain.
They improve code organization and readability by allowing developers to chain multiple asynchronous operations together, eliminating the need for deeply nested callback functions.
Promises facilitate error handling in asynchronous code by providing a consistent mechanism for handling both successful and failed outcomes of asynchronous operations.
