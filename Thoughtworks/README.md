To calculate the totalPrice with a 20% discount for a product with a price of 200, you can use the formula:

# totalPrice

price−(price×discount)
totalPrice=price−(price×discount)
where:

price is the original price of the product (200 in this case),
discount is the discount percentage (in decimal form, so 20% becomes 0.20).
Substituting the values into the formula:

# totalPrice

200−(200×0.20)
totalPrice=200−(200×0.20)

# totalPrice

200−40
totalPrice=200−40

# totalPrice

160
totalPrice=160
So, the totalPrice after applying a 20% discount to a product with a price of 200 would be 160.
