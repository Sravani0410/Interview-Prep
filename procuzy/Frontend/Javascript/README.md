## Implement based questions:
let's say we have a json object. if i gave you that different countries. data is like little complex in terms of a lot of nested objects:
lets say array of object , each object having each object represent the country. inside the country like there is array of languages spoken and another array of currencies that they used. lets say object having with all the information of capital city and then finicial well cities this king of an array of object we have.
so we have to find the tell me in which countries this languages spoken or particular language spoken.
so it will need bit of destructuring, bit of arrow functions knowledge. so all they are required.
